## Obsidian Plugin

So as you can see there are alot of commands, and here is what each command do

Easiest, most reliable way in a GitHub README: use an HTML **table** (GitHub allows raw HTML in Markdown).

Copy–paste this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">

### Left column
- Put normal Markdown here
- **Bold**, _italics_, lists, images, etc.
  
```bash
# code blocks work too
echo "hello"
````

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Right column

Text, images, badges…
