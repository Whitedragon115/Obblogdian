> how to run server

the main idea is to have a enviroment that can run nodejs v21+ and have two port to use, that's it

if you aren't profficnal here is some suggestion

1. Running on free VPS
   There are alot of option on internet, and most of it support running nodejs, but if supporting 2 port I don't know, here are some free vps I use while ago
   - https://freeserver.tw/
   - https://shdtw.cloud/
   - https://flybirdhost.net/
   - https://hypernology.com/
   - https://resonancecraft.net/
   - https://shop-fmdb.maybeisfree.host/
   
   > some of it might broken or stop service

2. Self host
   > This option is for those have a free computer at home and you can run it in a enviorment with internet 24/7

   **What you need**
   - Nodejs v21+ install
   - 2 port needed

   and if you are using Shared Network or Phone internet
   - Domain name
   - Cloudflare tunnel

   **How to instal**
   1. Install Nodejs v21+
   2. make a folder and download the code inside from https://cloud.dragoncode.dev/s/n5RCq and unzip it
   3. rename `rename to hexo` folder to hexo
   4. copy your entire hexo to `hexo` folder, it should look like this
      ![alt text](image-1.png)
   5. run index.js

   > if you are using Shared Network or Phone internet

   6. install Cloudflare tunnel
   7. in cloudflare zerotrust add a public hostname call `<preview>.yourdoamin.name` for previewing your blog online

   > yeah I am not so good at writing instruction so the text might not be clear, well I believe AI are good at this, so I write a prompt for setting up this project I hope this help you make it work
