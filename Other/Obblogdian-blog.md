## Environment Variables

Set these in your `.env` file or the host environment before running the server.

| Variable Name        | Description                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `API_TOKEN`          | Token used by the Obsidian plugin to authenticate with the server |
| `SERVER_LINK`        | Public preview URL for your blog (optional)                       |
| `WEBDAV_URL`         | WebDAV server URL used to sync notes                              |
| `WEBDAV_USERNAME`    | WebDAV username                                                   |
| `WEBDAV_PASSWORD`    | WebDAV password                                                   |
| `WEBDAV_REMOTE_BASE` | Remote base path on the WebDAV server                             |
| `AUTO_SHUTDOWN`      | Auto-shutdown timeout (seconds) â€” optional                        |
| `API_PORT`           | Port the API listens on (used by the Obsidian plugin)             |
| `PREVIEW_PORT`       | Port used for Hexo preview (the blog preview server)              |

```env
API_TOKEN = <Token used by the Obsidian plugin to authenticate with the server>
SERVER_LINK = <Public preview URL for your blog (optional)>
WEBDAV_URL = <WebDAV server URL used to sync notes>
WEBDAV_USERNAME = <WebDAV username>
WEBDAV_PASSWORD = <WebDAV password>
WEBDAV_REMOTE_BASE = <Remote base path on the WebDAV server>
AUTO_SHUTDOWN = <Auto-shutdown timeout (seconds) â€” optional>
API_PORT = <Port the API listens on (used by the Obsidian plugin)>
PREVIEW_PORT = <Port used for Hexo preview (the blog preview server)>
```

## How to run the server

The server requires Node.js v21+ and two available ports (API and preview). Below are two common hosting options and step-by-step instructions for each.

### 1) Run on a VPS

If you plan to use a VPS, choose a provider that supports Node.js and allows opening at least two ports. Some free or low-cost providers you can try (availability varies):

- <https://freeserver.tw/>
- <https://shdtw.cloud/>
- <https://flybirdhost.net/>
- <https://hypernology.com/>
- <https://resonancecraft.net/>
- <https://shop-fmdb.maybeisfree.host/>

> Note: free services may be unreliable or have limited network/port support.


### 2) Self-host (recommended if you have a spare machine)

If you have a machine that can run 24/7 on your home network, self-hosting is a good option. For NAT or mobile connections, you may need a domain and a tunnel (e.g. Cloudflare Tunnel).

**Requirements:**

- Node.js v21+ installed
- Two available ports (one for API, one for preview)
- Optional: domain name + Cloudflare Tunnel if under NAT or mobile networks

**Setup steps:**

1. Install Node.js v21+ on the host (see instructions below for Windows/Linux).
2. Create a working folder and download the [project files](release):
3. Rename the folder named `rename to hexo` to `hexo`.
4. Copy your existing Hexo blog into the `hexo` folder so the structure matches your Hexo site.

5. From the `Blog` folder, install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
cd Blog
npm install
node index.js
```

1. (If using a shared/mobile network) Install Cloudflare Tunnel and expose the preview port with Cloudflare Tunnel (what to set)

   We won't cover installation here. Follow the official guide:
   [Cloudflare Tunnel â€” Create a tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/)

    Configure these values for this project:

    - Tunnel name: any name (e.g., `obblogdian-preview`)
    - Hostname: the public URL you want (e.g., `preview.yourdomain.name`)
    - Service/URL target: `http://localhost:${PREVIEW_PORT}` (default `http://localhost:4001`)

## Contact / Hosting offer

I have a personal server where I can sometimes host small projects, but I cannot guarantee availability or security. I strongly recommend self-hosting or using a trusted VPS provider.

If you still need help and accept the risks, contact me on Discord (details at the bottom of the project) and we'll discuss options.
